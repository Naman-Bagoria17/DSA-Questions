make a bool 2d vector for visited cells
make a bool 2d vector isBorder to mark the border of component cells
make a queue for bfs
push given element in queue
store original value of given cell in a variable say "og"
now in bfs while loop
pop out front element from queue and make a border variable false
check its neighbour row and column
if any neighbour row or column is out of bound means curr cell was at border of grid
or if neighbour cell is not of same group as of og cell then also our cell is border of component
so make border variable true
else if cell is not visited
push it in queue and mark it visited
after all neighbours of current cell are processed 
check if border is true
then mark the curr cell true in isBorder vector


we cant make the grid cell color here bcz it will make problem for its neighbouring cells
then bcz for its neighbouring cells which will be of same component but not border cells, 
they will be marked as border bcz they will be adjacent to a cell that is 
now not in the component due to being updated
